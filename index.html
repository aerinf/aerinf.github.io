        <h1>Welcome to Brooklyn Tech!</h1>
        <p>My name is Aerin Franklin. I'm currently a Brooklyn Tech senior in the Software Engineering major. I 
            spend my free time wrestling for Tech and trying to keep my grades up. After more than three years, I think I know 
            this school pretty well. It's tough, but there are lots of good things about it, and if you work hard, 
            you'll definitely succeed. I truly love Tech: the odd beauty of some rooms, 
            the friends I've made, the challenging classes, the politics between majors, and the feeling of being one of six thousand. 
            And hey, Brooklyn Tech even taught me how to make a website!
            There are more opportunities at Tech than at any other high school, 
            and I'm sure you'll fall in love with this school too.
